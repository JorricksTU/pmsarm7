  "body": "### Motivation\r\nSince dev2day pms repository is outdated has been a while, I decided to create an automatic solution to have fresh .deb files in an APT repository as soon as Plex release their binaries. You might want to use this solution if you have an ARM based linux, such as a NAS or Raspberry Pie.\r\n\r\n### Setup\r\n```bash\r\necho \"deb http://dl.bintray.com/tproenca/pmsarm7 jessie main\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pms.list\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Instalation\r\n```bash\r\nsudo apt-get update\r\nsudo apt-get install plexmediaserver\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Thanks\r\n* Special thanks to HTPC Guides team for the great tutorials\r\n* To Jan Friedrich (uglymagoo) <<jft@dev2day.de>> for providing the base skeleton.tgz",
